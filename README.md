# HNG-TASK-1
My name is Odinaka Onuigbo. I am an identity designer and network engineer. I started designing after I had left school. While working on photography I quickly observed how my obsession with designs was related to photos. I was intrigued by how a designer's constrictions influence his creativity and craft.

I am self-taught, with additional training in view. My aim someday is to develop a product that solves one of our problems in Africa.
